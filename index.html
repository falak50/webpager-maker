        <h1>Front-End Developer</h1>
        <h3>Falak Ahmed Shakib</h3>
        <p>As a Front-end web development, also known as client-side development is the practice of producing HTML, CSS
          and JavaScript for a website or Web Application so that a user can see and interact with them directly. The
          challenge associated with front end development is that the tools and techniques used to create the front end
          of
          a website change constantly .

        <p>I will start with PHP where we will cover basic syntax, variables, loops and decision constructs. Then we
          will
          learn object oriented features along with string functions. After this we will move to arrays then after
          understand how REQUEST, GET, and POST works with server variables. Next will be how to connect to MySQL
          database.</p>
